Common properties of all coq-contribs:

- The URL of the git repository of each coq-contrib is:

    https://github.com/coq-contribs/$NAME.git

- Each of those repositories is registered as a submodule of:

    https://github.com/coq-contribs/coq-contribs.git

- Compilability of each of the coq-contribs is tracked by this job:

    https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/coq-contribs/job/coq-contribs

- Installability of each of the coq-contribs (via OPAM) is tracked by this job:

    https://ci.inria.fr/coq/job/opam-install/

  NOTE: that means that for each coq-contribs there must be OPAM packages that enable us to install it when we have

    coq.dev
    coq.8.5.dev
    ...
    coq.8.5.1
    coq.8.5.0

  The names of the packages should be "coq-$NAME"
  where $NAME is the name of the coq-contrib.

- Each coq-contrib should have the following branches:

  - master ... for code compatible with Coq "trunk" branch
  - v8.5   ... for code compatible with Coq "v8.5" branch

- Each coq-contrib should have at least the following tag:

  - 8.5.0

  which designates a state of the codebase compilable with Coq 8.5.

- A coq-contrib can depend only on the Coq standard library or another coq-contrib

- All coq-contribs have "description" file which has the following structure

  - Name
  - Title

  - Email
  - Homepage
  - (Institution)
  - Date
  - Description
  - Url

- Each coq-contrib has a toplevel Makefile whose default rule builds that coq-contrib and the "install" target installs it to the "user-contrib" directory
