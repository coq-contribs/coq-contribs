# Coq-contribs

This is a git repository centralizing the previous Coq contribution system by
means of git submodules. The old system consisted of an SVN repository
containing all contribs in the same place, while now they are stored in their
own git repository.

To install:

* Clone this repository.
* Initialize the submodules.
```
git submodule init
```
* Update all contribs in one command.
```
git submodule update --remote
```
