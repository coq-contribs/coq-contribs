# coq-contribs

Originally, [coq-contribs](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/coq/pylons/contribs/index) mechanism allowed Coq users
to publish their work and allow others to install and use it. Nowadays, this is achieved via [OPAM](http://coq-blog.clarus.me/use-opam-for-coq.html).

All coq-contribs submitted by users were later released via OPAM.

Each submodule of this repository represents a single coq-contrib.

The linked repository represents an upstream version if and only if it is not a fork.

If the linked repository is an upstream version, Coq developers may provide the corresponding OPAM package(s).
